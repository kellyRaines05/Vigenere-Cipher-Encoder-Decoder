# Vigenere-Cipher-Encoder-Decoder
Usage: cargo run <input file> <e/d> <key>
Instructions: Write any message you want in the input file to be encoded or decoded using the Vigen√®re cipher.
I used test.txt as my input file if you would also like to use it as well, but any text file can be used.
"e" indicates encoding the input file while "d" indicates decoding the input file. All encoded messages will be
outputted to translate.txt. Lastly, the key will be provided by the user to encode which can be anything the user wants. However,
when decoding the key provided must be the appropriate key used when it was encoded. For example, if you
ask the program to encode a file using the key: "puppy", it must use the same key, "puppy" to decode.
